# Add IMDb Rating and Release Year to Movies

Using [OMDb API](omdbapi.com), add movie release year, and/or IMDb movie rating to a file whose name is a movie title.

#### rating-fetcher
Try to search for ratings of movies from all local files in the directory the source file is present. If a score is found for a file name, rename the file and prepend the score. 

#### year-fetcher
Try to look for the release year of movies from all local files in the same directory as the source file. If a release year is found for a file name, rename the file and append the release year.

## Usage

1. Decide if you want the rating or the release year (or both!) you want added to your file names
2. Download the corresponding file
3. Place the downloaded file in the same folder as your movie files
4. Run the python script using one of the following commands:
   1. `python3 rating-fetcher.py`
   2. `python3 year-fetcher.py`
5. Voil√†! All valid movies now have more information to help you decide what to watch next.
